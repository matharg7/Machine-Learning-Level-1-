# Problem Statement </br>
Harry and Hermione are in the 2nd year of Hogwarts *(for those who haven't watched Harry Potter series, it's a magic school)*. While wandering around Hogwarts, they came across a room filled with new potions that are being created. Both Harry and Hermione want to find out the category that each of the potions belong to, so that they can use them for appropriate scenarios.</br>

Assume that there are only **4 categories of potions** that are being prepared in the room. The compositions of each potion vary over a range of values. A book with the data of various potions, their compositions and the corresponding categories available in the school library. </br>

Categories of the potions are *anti-aging*, *transmigration*, *memory* and *healing*. <br/>

**Help the wizards identify the types of potions and support them in perfecting the art of magic!**
